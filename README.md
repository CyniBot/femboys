# screamshot
Lightshot allows users to select an area on their desktop and screenshot their selection. Users are then able to upload screenshots to the Lightshot website and share a link to the screenshot, which uses the domain `prntscr.com`. screamshot takes advantage of the popularity of Lightshot and users' ignorance when clicking on domains. screamshot uses the domain `pnrtscr.com` to trick users into believing they are about to view a screenshot, thus giving users a false sense of security.
